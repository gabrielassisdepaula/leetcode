# 304. Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable

### Range Sum 1

After understanding how 2D Prefix Sums are calculated I coded the first solution with the math help from Profound Academy - 2D Prefix Sum and Sumatrix Sum Queries video.

It has a lot of comments to help me understand in case I forget something.

### Range Sum 2

After the first solution I went to check on NeetCode's solution. I liked the prefix sum calculation a bit better. The sum function was pretty much the same.

### Range Sum 3

Merged both solutions and made it with less code and thus less readabilty. Also removed most of the coments.
